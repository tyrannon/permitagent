## Claude-Prompter CLI Tool Integration 🚀

### Overview
A powerful CLI tool that enables Claude to generate intelligent prompt suggestions based on conversation context. This creates a feedback loop between Claude and GPT-4o for enhanced development assistance.

### Important: Tool Location
**The claude-prompter tool is located in a separate directory:**
```bash
cd /Users/kaiyakramer/claude-prompter
```

### How We Use It in PermitAI Development

#### Interactive Workflow (What We've Been Doing)
1. **Navigate to claude-prompter directory first**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kaiyakramer/claude-prompter
   ```

2. **Run commands with the --send flag for real GPT-4 responses**:
   ```bash
   # Example from our session - getting database architecture advice
   npx claude-prompter prompt -m "I'm building a permit management system with PostgreSQL and Prisma. Should I use separate tables for each permit type or a single table with type field?" --send
   
   # Example - OCR microservice architecture
   npx claude-prompter prompt -m "I need to integrate PaddleOCR into a Node.js/Express API. Should I create a Python microservice or use Node bindings?" --send
   ```

3. **Real examples from our development**:
   ```bash
   # When we needed document upload architecture advice
   npx claude-prompter prompt -m "Building document upload system for permits. Compare MinIO vs S3 vs local storage for government compliance" --send
   
   # When designing the OCR integration
   npx claude-prompter prompt -m "Best architecture for OCR service: Python FastAPI microservice vs Node.js integration for PaddleOCR?" --send
   ```

### Quick Reference (From claude-prompter directory)
```bash
# Navigate to tool directory
cd /Users/kaiyakramer/claude-prompter

# Generate suggestions for your current task
npx claude-prompter suggest -t "permit application API" --code -l typescript --task-type backend-service --claude-analysis

# Send a prompt to GPT-4o (what we use most)
npx claude-prompter prompt -m "How should I structure the permit workflow state machine?" --send

# Get suggestions after building features
npx claude-prompter suggest -t "document OCR processing" --code -l typescript --complexity complex --claude-analysis
```

### Usage Examples for PermitAI Development

#### After Creating API Endpoints
```bash
cd /Users/kaiyakramer/claude-prompter
npx claude-prompter suggest -t "permit submission API with validation" --code -l typescript --task-type api-integration --claude-analysis
```

#### For Architecture Decisions (Most Common Use)
```bash
cd /Users/kaiyakramer/claude-prompter
npx claude-prompter prompt -m "microservice architecture for permit processing with government compliance requirements" --send
```

### Key Commands
- `suggest`: Generate categorized prompt suggestions based on context
- `prompt`: Send prompts directly to GPT-4o (use with --send)
- `usage`: Track API usage and costs
- `--claude-analysis`: Always include when Claude is generating suggestions
- `--send`: CRITICAL flag to get real GPT-4 responses (not templates)

### Integration Workflow (How We've Been Using It)
1. Claude identifies a complex architectural decision
2. Claude navigates to `/Users/kaiyakramer/claude-prompter`
3. Claude runs prompt command with --send flag
4. GPT-4 provides architectural guidance
5. Claude implements based on recommendations
6. Process repeats for next complex decision

### Best Practices We've Learned
- Always cd to claude-prompter directory first
- Use --send flag for real architectural advice
- Keep prompts specific and technical
- Include context about government/compliance requirements
- Chain decisions: Claude → GPT-4 → Implementation → Next question

### Active Usage Guidelines
**IMPORTANT**: To get real AI suggestions (not templates):
```bash
# Always navigate to tool directory first
cd /Users/kaiyakramer/claude-prompter

# Then use --send flag for actual GPT-4 responses
npx claude-prompter prompt -m "How should I structure the permit database?" --send
```

**When to Use Actively**:
- Starting new features → Get architecture suggestions
- Solving complex problems → Get alternative approaches  
- Code reviews → Get optimization ideas
- Stuck on implementation → Get unstuck with fresh perspective
