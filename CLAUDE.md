# Claude AI Development Context for PermitAI

## Project Overview
PermitAI is a modern, AI-powered permitting platform designed to replace legacy government permitting systems like Accela. The project aims to automate repetitive workflows, provide AI-assisted form generation and intake, and translate unstructured communication into structured permit data.

## Current Status
- Project structure created with monorepo architecture
- Basic scaffolding for packages (api, core, ai, document-processor)
- Architecture and feature documentation completed
- Docker compose setup for local development

## Technical Context

### Architecture Summary
- **Frontend**: React (web), React Native (mobile), Electron (staff portal)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express with modular services
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (cache/queue), Pinecone (vectors)
- **AI Stack**: Claude 3, GPT-4o, Llama 3 (via Ollama), PaddleOCR
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes-ready

### Project Structure
```
permitai/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/           # Frontend applications
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/       # Core packages (api, core, ai, document-processor)
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/ # Docker, K8s configs
â””â”€â”€ docs/          # Documentation
```

### Key Files Created
- `/permitai/` - Main project directory
- `data-model.ts` - Complete TypeScript interfaces for permits
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed system architecture
- `FEATURES.md` - Feature specifications
- `ROADMAP.md` - Development timeline
- `project-structure.md` - File organization

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- TypeScript for type safety
- Functional programming where appropriate
- Interface-based design for flexibility
- Minimal comments (self-documenting code)
- Follow existing patterns in codebase

### AI Integration Approach
1. Use LLMRouter for model selection (packages/ai/src/llm/router.ts)
2. Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
3. Log AI confidence scores for analysis
4. Design prompts for specific, structured outputs

### Security Considerations
- Never hardcode API keys or secrets
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Audit log all permit actions

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Tasks
1. Fix npm workspace setup for proper monorepo
2. Implement Prisma schema for database
3. Create basic authentication system
4. Build document upload endpoint
5. Integrate PaddleOCR for text extraction

### Week 1 Goals
- Working development environment
- Basic API with auth
- Document upload and storage
- Simple OCR implementation
- Database migrations

## Common Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/kaiyakramer/permitagent/permitai

# Start Docker services
npm run docker:up

# For now, install dependencies in each package
cd packages/api && npm install
cd packages/core && npm install

# Run development server (after setup)
npm run dev
```

## Claude-Prompter CLI Tool Integration ðŸš€

### Overview
A powerful CLI tool that enables Claude to generate intelligent prompt suggestions based on conversation context. This creates a feedback loop between Claude and GPT-4o for enhanced development assistance.

### Quick Start
```bash
# Generate suggestions for your current task
claude-prompter suggest -t "permit application API" --code -l typescript --task-type backend-service --claude-analysis

# Send a prompt to GPT-4o
claude-prompter prompt -m "How should I structure the permit workflow state machine?" --send

# Get suggestions after building features
claude-prompter suggest -t "document OCR processing" --code -l typescript --complexity complex --claude-analysis
```

### Usage Examples for PermitAI Development

#### After Creating API Endpoints
```bash
claude-prompter suggest -t "permit submission API with validation" --code -l typescript --task-type api-integration --claude-analysis
```

#### After Building UI Components
```bash
claude-prompter suggest -t "permit application form component" --code -l react --task-type ui-component --claude-analysis
```

#### For Architecture Decisions
```bash
claude-prompter suggest -t "microservice architecture for permit processing" --complexity complex --claude-analysis
```

#### For AI Integration
```bash
claude-prompter suggest -t "LLM router for multi-model AI system" --code -l typescript --task-type backend-service --complexity complex --claude-analysis
```

### Key Commands
- `suggest`: Generate categorized prompt suggestions based on context
- `prompt`: Send prompts directly to GPT-4o
- `usage`: Track API usage and costs
- `--claude-analysis`: Always include when Claude is generating suggestions

### Integration Workflow
1. Claude helps build a feature in PermitAI
2. Claude runs suggest command with appropriate parameters
3. Tool generates categorized suggestions (follow-up, clarification, deep-dive, etc.)
4. User picks a suggestion for next steps
5. Conversation continues with deeper insights

### Best Practices
- Use specific topics for better suggestions
- Include language and task-type for code-related tasks
- Set complexity level (simple/moderate/complex) appropriately
- Chain suggestions: Claude â†’ Tool â†’ GPT-4o â†’ Claude

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Monorepo**: Using Turborepo for better code sharing
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type safety
3. **AI Strategy**: Hybrid approach with multiple models
4. **Architecture**: Microservices-ready but starting monolithic
5. **Security**: JWT auth with refresh tokens
