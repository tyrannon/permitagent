# Security & Compliance Strategy for PermitAI

## Overview

Government permitting systems handle sensitive citizen data, financial transactions, and legal documents. This document outlines the security and compliance requirements for PermitAI to be production-ready for government use.

## Compliance Framework Priority

### Phase 1: MVP (Current)
- Basic security practices
- JWT authentication
- HTTPS everywhere
- Input validation
- Audit logging

### Phase 2: Municipal Pilot
- SOC 2 Type I preparation
- Enhanced encryption
- MFA implementation
- Penetration testing
- Security policies documentation

### Phase 3: State/Federal Ready
- FedRAMP Moderate authorization
- StateRAMP certification
- CJIS compliance (if needed)
- SOC 2 Type II
- PCI DSS (for payments)

## Technical Implementation Roadmap

### Immediate (MVP)
```typescript
// Already implemented in Prisma schema:
- Audit logging (AuditLog model)
- Session management (Session model)
- Role-based access (Role model)
```

### Next Sprint
1. **Encryption at Rest**
   - Enable Prisma field-level encryption
   - Encrypt file storage in MinIO
   - Use AWS KMS or similar for key management

2. **Enhanced Authentication**
   - Implement MFA with TOTP
   - Add OAuth2/SAML for enterprise SSO
   - Session security hardening

3. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting per user/IP
   - API key management
   - Request signing

### Production Requirements

#### Database Security
```prisma
// Add to schema.prisma for field encryption
model User {
  // ... existing fields
  
  @@map("users")
  @@schema("secure") // Separate schema for PII
}

// Add encrypted fields for sensitive data
model Payment {
  // ... existing fields
  
  cardNumberHash    String?  @db.Text @encrypted
  accountNumberHash  String?  @db.Text @encrypted
}
```

#### Infrastructure Architecture
```yaml
# Production architecture
├── Public Subnet (DMZ)
│   ├── WAF
│   ├── Load Balancer
│   └── Bastion Host
├── Private Subnet (Application)
│   ├── API Servers
│   ├── Background Workers
│   └── Cache Layer
└── Isolated Subnet (Data)
    ├── PostgreSQL (Primary)
    ├── PostgreSQL (Replica)
    └── MinIO (Encrypted Storage)
```

## Compliance Checklist

### FedRAMP Controls (Subset)
- [ ] AC-2: Account Management
- [ ] AC-3: Access Enforcement  
- [ ] AU-2: Audit Events
- [ ] AU-3: Content of Audit Records
- [ ] CA-7: Continuous Monitoring
- [ ] CM-2: Baseline Configuration
- [ ] IA-2: Multi-factor Authentication
- [ ] SC-8: Transmission Confidentiality
- [ ] SC-13: Cryptographic Protection
- [ ] SI-4: System Monitoring

### Development Practices
- [ ] Security training for all developers
- [ ] Secure code review process
- [ ] Dependency scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Container image scanning
- [ ] Secrets management (no hardcoded secrets)
- [ ] Security champions program

## Cost Implications

### Estimated Additional Costs for Compliance
1. **FedRAMP Authorization**: $250K-$500K
2. **Annual Audits**: $50K-$100K/year
3. **Security Tools**: $5K-$15K/month
4. **Compliance Personnel**: 1-2 FTEs
5. **Infrastructure (GovCloud)**: 30-50% premium

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Start with SOC 2** - Easier path, widely accepted
2. **Partner with Compliance Experts** - Don't go it alone
3. **Automate Evidence Collection** - Reduce audit burden
4. **Design for Compliance** - Cheaper than retrofitting
5. **Use FedRAMP-authorized services** - Inherit controls

## Security Features to Highlight

### For Government Buyers
- "Built for FedRAMP from day one"
- "Zero-trust architecture"
- "Automated compliance reporting"
- "US-based data residency"
- "Background-checked personnel"

### Technical Differentiators
- Immutable audit logs with blockchain option
- AI-powered anomaly detection
- Automated security patching
- Real-time threat intelligence
- Quantum-ready encryption

## Implementation Timeline

### Months 1-3 (Current)
- Basic security implementation
- Audit logging
- Authentication system

### Months 4-6
- SOC 2 Type I preparation
- Penetration testing
- Security documentation

### Months 7-12
- FedRAMP preparation
- Continuous monitoring implementation
- Third-party audits

### Year 2
- FedRAMP authorization process
- StateRAMP certification
- Expand to federal market

## Recommended Partners

1. **FedRAMP Advisory**
   - A-LIGN
   - Coalfire
   - Schellman

2. **Security Tools**
   - Snyk (dependency scanning)
   - Qualys (vulnerability management)
   - Splunk (SIEM)
   - CrowdStrike (endpoint protection)

3. **Infrastructure**
   - AWS GovCloud
   - Azure Government
   - Google Cloud for Government

## Key Takeaways

1. **Security is not optional** - It's table stakes for government
2. **Compliance is expensive** - Budget accordingly
3. **Start early** - Retrofitting is 10x more expensive
4. **Automate everything** - Manual compliance doesn't scale
5. **Partner wisely** - Experience matters in compliance

## Next Actions

1. Implement MFA in authentication system
2. Add field-level encryption to Prisma schema
3. Create security policy documentation
4. Engage SOC 2 auditor for readiness assessment
5. Budget for compliance in funding rounds
