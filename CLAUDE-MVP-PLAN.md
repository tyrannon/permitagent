# PermitAgent MVP Implementation Plan: Solving Every Accela Nightmare

## Core Problems We're Solving

### The Pain You Know Too Well
1. **Wrong Permit Type Hell**: Staff creates wrong record type, fees are wrong, workflow is wrong, EVERYTHING needs manual fixing
2. **Workflow Blindness**: Nobody knows what happens next, tasks appear randomly, no visibility
3. **Task List Nightmare**: Permit techs begging for filters that never work right
4. **Undo Impossibility**: One wrong click = hours of cleanup
5. **Fee Chaos**: Annual PDF updates that nobody implements correctly
6. **Scattered Records**: One project across 20 different records, nothing connected
7. **Analytics Void**: "Are we slow or is the customer slow?" Nobody knows!

## MVP Foundation Architecture

### 1. AI-Powered Record Screen (The Heart)
```typescript
interface SmartRecordCreation {
  // AI analyzes description and suggests record type
  aiRecordTypeSuggestion: {
    analyze: (description: string) => RecordTypePrediction[];
    confidence: number;
    alternatives: RecordType[];
  };
  
  // Prevents wrong record type selection
  validationEngine: {
    checkCompatibility: (recordType, projectDescription) => ValidationResult;
    suggestCorrections: () => CorrectionSuggestion[];
  };
  
  // Smart field population
  autoFillFromHistory: (applicant: Person) => FieldValues;
  extractFromDocuments: (uploads: Document[]) => FieldValues;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Natural language project description
- AI suggests correct permit types (with confidence scores)
- Shows fee preview BEFORE creation
- Validates against common mistakes
- One record per project with sub-permits linked

### 2. Intelligent Workflow Engine
```typescript
interface AIWorkflowEngine {
  // Current state awareness
  currentState: {
    task: WorkflowTask;
    assignee: User;
    daysInTask: number;
    bottleneck: boolean;
  };
  
  // Next step prediction
  predictNextSteps: () => TaskPrediction[];
  suggestOptimalPath: () => WorkflowPath;
  
  // Smart routing
  autoRoute: {
    basedOnContent: (documents: Document[]) => Department;
    basedOnHistory: (similarPermits: Permit[]) => User;
    loadBalance: (workload: DepartmentWorkload) => User;
  };
  
  // UNDO capability!
  workflowHistory: {
    canUndo: boolean;
    undoImpact: Impact[];
    executeUndo: () => void;
  };
}
```

**Revolutionary Features:**
- SEE the entire workflow visually
- KNOW what happens next
- UNDO workflow actions (with impact preview)
- AI routes to right person based on workload
- Predict bottlenecks before they happen

### 3. Smart Task Management
```typescript
interface IntelligentTaskList {
  // AI-powered filters that actually work
  smartFilters: {
    "Show me what I should work on next": Task[];
    "Find stuck permits": Task[];
    "Tasks due this week": Task[];
    "High priority by citizen impact": Task[];
  };
  
  // Bulk operations with AI safety
  bulkActions: {
    validate: (tasks: Task[], action: Action) => ValidationResult;
    preview: (tasks: Task[], action: Action) => ImpactPreview;
    execute: (tasks: Task[], action: Action) => Result[];
    undo: (actionId: string) => void;
  };
}
```

### 4. Analytics That Answer Real Questions
```typescript
interface SmartAnalytics {
  // Bottleneck detection
  bottlenecks: {
    current: BottleneckLocation[];
    historical: BottleneckTrend[];
    predictions: FutureBottleneck[];
  };
  
  // Blame game solver
  delays: {
    customerCaused: DelayAnalysis;
    staffCaused: DelayAnalysis;
    systemCaused: DelayAnalysis;
  };
  
  // Efficiency scoring
  efficiency: {
    byDepartment: EfficiencyScore[];
    byPermitType: EfficiencyScore[];
    byStaff: EfficiencyScore[];
    recommendations: Improvement[];
  };
}
```

**Analytics Magic:**
- "Customer submitted incomplete plans 3 times" - clearly shown
- "Permit stuck in review for 14 days" - red flag
- "Fire department is the bottleneck" - data proves it
- Weekly email: "You're 23% more efficient than last month!"

### 5. Fee Management That Doesn't Suck
```typescript
interface SmartFeeEngine {
  // PDF ingestion with AI
  importFeeSchedule: {
    fromPDF: (pdf: File) => FeeSchedule;
    validateChanges: (old: FeeSchedule, new: FeeSchedule) => Changes[];
    preview: (permit: Permit) => FeeCalculation;
  };
  
  // Adjustment paradise
  adjustments: {
    reason: string;
    aiSuggested: boolean;
    impact: FinancialImpact;
    requiresApproval: boolean;
    undoable: true; // ALWAYS!
  };
  
  // Refund automation
  refunds: {
    calculate: (permit: Permit) => RefundAmount;
    reason: RefundReason;
    oneClick: boolean;
  };
}
```

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Foundation + Auth
```bash
# Database schema that doesn't suck
- Single project → multiple permits (linked!)
- Workflow state tracking with history
- Audit everything (for undo capability)
- Smart indexes for instant search

# Auth that works
- JWT with refresh tokens
- Role-based (but AI suggests permissions)
- SSO ready for government
```

### Week 2: Core Screens + AI Integration
```bash
# Record/Permit Creation Screen
- Natural language input
- AI type suggestion
- Fee preview
- Validation before save

# Workflow Visualization
- See entire workflow
- Current position highlighted
- Bottlenecks in red
- Drag-drop to reassign
```

### Week 3: Smart Features
```bash
# AI Task Routing
- Load balancing
- Skill matching
- Deadline awareness
- Vacation coverage

# Analytics Dashboard
- Real-time bottlenecks
- Efficiency scores
- Blame attribution
- Actionable insights
```

### Week 4: Polish + Demo Prep
```bash
# The "Holy Shit" Demos
1. Wrong permit type → AI catches it
2. Workflow stuck → One-click fix
3. Fee confusion → Clear breakdown
4. Analytics question → Instant answer
5. Bulk update → With preview + undo
```

## Data Model That Makes Sense

```typescript
// One project, multiple permits - CONNECTED!
interface Project {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  address: Address;
  applicant: Person;
  permits: Permit[]; // ALL related permits
  documents: Document[]; // Shared documents
  timeline: Timeline; // Unified view
  analytics: ProjectAnalytics;
}

// Permit with full context
interface Permit {
  id: string;
  projectId: string; // ALWAYS linked to project
  type: PermitType;
  workflow: {
    current: WorkflowState;
    history: WorkflowHistory[];
    predictions: NextSteps[];
  };
  fees: {
    calculated: Fee[];
    paid: Payment[];
    adjustments: Adjustment[];
    refunds: Refund[];
  };
  aiMetadata: {
    confidence: number;
    suggestedType: boolean;
    autoRoutingUsed: boolean;
    bottleneckRisk: number;
  };
}
```

## The Demos That Sell

### Demo 1: "No More Wrong Permits"
1. Type: "I want to add a bathroom"
2. AI suggests: "Plumbing Permit + Building Permit"
3. Shows fees instantly
4. Creates linked permits in one project

### Demo 2: "Workflow Transparency"
1. Show permit in review
2. "What happens next?" → Visual workflow
3. "Who should review?" → AI suggestion
4. "Oops, wrong person" → Undo button!

### Demo 3: "Analytics That Matter"
1. "Why are permits slow?"
2. Dashboard shows: "Customer resubmissions: 65% of delays"
3. Drill down to specific permits
4. Export report for council meeting

### Demo 4: "Fee Chaos Solved"
1. Upload new fee schedule PDF
2. AI extracts and compares to current
3. Preview impact on active permits
4. One-click update with audit trail

## Why This Wins

- Task lists that actually help
- No more "which record type?"
- Bulk operations without fear
- See what's coming next

### For Engineers/Planners
- Know your queue instantly
- Undo mistakes easily
- AI helps with decisions
- No more scattered records

### For Building Officials
- Real-time dashboard that matters
- Prove efficiency with data
- Find bottlenecks instantly
- Make informed decisions

### For Citizens

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Set up Next.js + Prisma + PostgreSQL
2. **Tomorrow**: Build project-centric data model
3. **This Week**: AI integration for record type suggestion
4. **Next Week**: Workflow engine with undo
5. **Week 3**: Analytics that prove value
6. **Week 4**: Demo that drops jaws

## The Bottom Line

We're not building a better Accela. We're building what permit software should have been from day one. Every feature solves a REAL pain point you've experienced. Every AI suggestion prevents a mistake you've had to fix. Every analytics view answers a question you've been asked.

This is the system that makes government workers say: "Finally, someone who gets it!"

*Let's build the permit system that doesn't suck.*
