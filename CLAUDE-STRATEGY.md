# PermitAgent Strategic Vision: Building the Future of Government Permitting

## Executive Summary

PermitAgent is positioned to disrupt the $2.3B government permitting software market by leveraging AI-first architecture to solve problems that legacy systems like Accela cannot address. With 15+ years of industry pain points and your deep Accela experience, we're building what government agencies desperately need but current vendors can't deliver.

## Why We Will Win
