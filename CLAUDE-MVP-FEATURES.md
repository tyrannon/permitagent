# PermitAgent MVP: 30-Day Sprint to Demo

## MVP Goal
Build a working demo that makes government officials say "Holy shit, we need this NOW!"

## Core MVP Features (Must Have)

### 1. Magic Document Upload
**What It Does**: Upload ANY permit-related document and watch the magic
- **Accepts**: PDF, images, Word docs, even photos of handwritten applications
- **AI Processing**:
  - Extracts all text via OCR
  - Identifies document type automatically
  - Pulls out key data (addresses, square footage, contractor info)
  - Creates structured permit application
- **Demo Power**: Upload a crumpled contractor's estimate → Full permit draft

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
// packages/ai/src/document-processor.ts
export class DocumentProcessor {
  async processDocument(file: Buffer): Promise<PermitApplication> {
    const text = await this.ocr.extract(file);
    const documentType = await this.classifier.identify(text);
    const extractedData = await this.llm.extractStructuredData(text, documentType);
    return this.permitBuilder.createApplication(extractedData);
  }
}
```

### 2. Conversational Permit Assistant
**What It Does**: Natural language permit guidance
- **Chat Interface**: "I want to build a deck on my house"
- **AI Response**: 
  - Determines permit types needed
  - Asks clarifying questions
  - Generates application
  - Explains requirements in plain English

**Demo Script**:
```
User: "I want to add a bathroom to my basement"
AI: "I'll help you with that! For a basement bathroom addition, you'll need:
- Building Permit (for structural changes)
- Plumbing Permit (for new fixtures)
- Electrical Permit (for lighting/outlets)

Let me ask a few questions:
1. What's the square footage of the addition?
2. Will you need to break through the foundation?
3. Is this in a single-family home?

Based on your answers, I'll generate the complete application package."
```

### 3. Instant Permit Analyzer
**What It Does**: AI pre-review in seconds
- **Input**: Completed application + supporting docs
- **Output**: 
  - Completeness check
  - Code compliance analysis
  - Missing items list
  - Approval likelihood score

**Visual Demo**: Dashboard showing:
- ✅ Application complete
- ⚠️ Site plan missing setback dimensions
- ✅ Contractor license verified
- ℹ️ Similar permits approved in 5-7 days

### 4. One-Click Accela Import
**What It Does**: Migrate from Accela in minutes
- **Process**:
  1. Enter Accela credentials
  2. Select data to import
  3. Watch real-time migration
  4. View in PermitAgent format

**Demo Impact**: "Your 10 years of Accela data, imported in 10 minutes"

### 5. Real-Time Status Dashboard
**What It Does**: Beautiful, actionable permit tracking
- **For Citizens**: Track application like Amazon package
- **For Staff**: AI-prioritized review queue
- **For Managers**: Real-time KPIs and bottleneck alerts

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Contractor Efficiency
**Setup**: Contractor has photos of plans on phone
**Demo**: 
1. Upload photos directly from mobile
2. AI extracts all permit info
3. Application completed in 2 minutes
4. Compare to 2-hour Accela process

### Scenario 2: Homeowner Self-Service
**Setup**: Homeowner wants to build fence
**Demo**:
1. Chat: "I want to build a 6-foot fence"
2. AI guides through requirements
3. Generates application with code references
4. Shows estimated approval timeline

### Scenario 3: Staff Productivity
**Setup**: Building inspector with 50 applications
**Demo**:
1. AI pre-reviews all applications
2. Flags only 5 needing human review
3. Inspector clears backlog in 1 hour
4. Show time saved metrics

### Scenario 4: Manager Intelligence
**Setup**: Director needs performance report
**Demo**:
1. Real-time dashboard loads instantly
2. AI identifies bottlenecks
3. Suggests process improvements
4. Predicts future workload

## Success Metrics for MVP

### Quantitative
- Process building permit in <5 minutes (vs 45+ in Accela)
- 90%+ OCR accuracy on typed documents
- <2 second response time for all operations
- 80% reduction in manual data entry

### Qualitative
- "This is exactly what we've been looking for"
